🚀 Thrilled to present our latest project — Ceylon Eco Foods! 🌿🍍

We’ve developed a fully dynamic web-based Food Processing Factory Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

The system streamlines the connection between farmers, customers, and administrators, enabling:
 ✅ Supplier portal to register farmers and sell their fruits to the factory
 ✅ Customer portal to browse and purchase processed products
 ✅ Seperate admin portals to manage operations through a complete CRUD-based dashboard

This project focuses on promoting efficiency, transparency, and sustainability within the food supply chain while delivering a smooth, responsive user experience.
